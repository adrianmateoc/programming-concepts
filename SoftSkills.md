## SOFT SKILLS

Soft skills are skills you use in your relationships with other people.
There are some of them that you should adopt and others that you should avoid.

**Skills to Adopt**

- Empathy: Empathizing allows you to see things from the other's point of view and thus understand them in a better way. It also allows you 
  to know how others will react to our actions, so we can adapt our way of expressing ourselves towards them.
  
- Communication: Communication is very important, therefore you always have to be willing to give your opinion. Some things to keep in mind when communicating are:
  1. Speak clearly and with conviction, this way people will pay more attention to what you say.
  2. Listen to what others have to say, it is a very important part of communication.
  3. Do not interrupt when another is giving his opinion, wait until he is finished and then state your opinion.
  
- Teamwork: You will have to work as a team, so you must bear in mind that not everyone thinks like you, for that reason you will have to be 
  willing to collaborate and achieve a common goal. Working well with other people makes it more fun and in the future, thanks to the relationship established with those people, it is easier to get help.
  
- Approachability and Helpfulness: At some point, someone's going to want to ask you something. If you don't help him, it's possible that a 
  small problem can turn into a big one. Not being accessible or helpful can cause others to not help you either. If you are busy make it clear that you are busy and if necessary set a time when you can meet to discuss things.
  
- Patience: Be patient with people who need it. Some people do not understand the magnitude of the things they request, for that reason you have to be patient and explain to them why it is not possible.

- Open-mindedness: Keep an open mind, as even the worst ideas can become the beginning of something great. You also have to take into account the ideas of everyone, including customers, since they are the people who use the product.

- Problem solving: Knowing how to deal with problems is very important both for your career and for the company you work for. When a problem is found, locate the cause and objectively try to solve it. You have to keep in mind that you do not have to solve it alone, working with other people will help to solve it before.

- Accountability: Hiding a mistake is bad for you and the entire company, as it is possible that the same mistake will be made again. For that reason, the correct thing to do is to raise your hand, admit fault and solve the problem so that it does not happen again.

- Creativity: Creativity is important when programming as it will help us find good ideas for our projects. The best way to gain creativity will be with practice, exploring forms of creativity.

- Time management: Managing time is very important as it allows you to focus more on the truly important things and do them more efficiently.

- Being eager: Being eager to learn new technologies is essential for a developer, as something new comes out every day. This reason forces us to keep ourselves updated in order to be more interesting for companies or simply to have more knowledge.

- PEC (Plan, Estimate, Commit) Skill: The most followed practice in our day is “Scrum Practice”. According to SCRUM, developing something must have iterations, in which each one adds value to the product. Each iteration is called "Sprints", and last from a week to a month. In each "Sprint" we will estimate the number of tasks that we can do and we will commit to do it in the established time. Our PEC ability will improve the more we use it.

**Skills to Avoid**

- Perfectionism: This is one of the worst abilities as it spends a lot of time on unnecessary details. It is better to be an optimal perfectionist and deliver the best result under the given restrictions.

- Being Specialist or Generalist: It is possible that you are sought after for a specific knowledge and that type of person is sought after by companies. It may also be that you know a little about everything but nothing in depth, these types of people are not sought by companies. So, it is best to be a "T" shaped developer, developers who have a general knowledge of many things and an in-depth knowledge of a specific one are called that.

- Staying inside the Comfort Zone: As I said, you have to be eager and go out from the Comfort Zone. It won't help you to raise your abilities and to be sought after by companies.

- Being Passive: You have to be outgoing and express your opinion about things that require it. If something can be improved thanks to your opinion, we must use it.

- Bragging: Development today is a collective activity. For this reason you should not brag about anything you have developed or keep all the credit for yourself.
