##How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You

**Why improve your code reviews?**

- Learn faster: If you show your reviewer that you appreciate constructive criticism, your reviewer will provide better feedback and learn more.

- Make others better: Having good review practices spreads to your colleagues, so it will make your job easier when they send you code.

- Minimize team conflicts: Approaching code reviews minimizes the friction they cause between the reviewer and the person being reviewed.

**The golden rule: value your reviewer's time**

You have to put effort into making the minimum mistakes and be worried about the work you are doing to be as clean as possible.

**Techniques**

- Review your own code first

Before sending the code, review it and in addition to looking for errors you should look for misunderstandings and confusing things.

- Write a clear changelist description

You have to write a clean changelist that is understandable to anyone who reads it. You should clarify confusing things in the description if necessary.

- Automate the easy stuff

Having your code reviewed should not preclude automated testing. If the company wants to exclude automated tests, you will have to implement them yourself.

- Answer questions with the code itself

When there are confusions in the code, they must be solved. The comments in the code can be a help, but the best option would be to fix the misunderstanding in the code.

- Narrowly scope changes

It is necessary to clarify the changes that are made, the smaller and more precise the change, the more understandable it will be for those who see it.

- Separate functional and non-functional changes

You have to separate functional changes and non-functional changes, as it will be hard for the reviewer to find a feature change buried in a bunch of whitespace changes.

- Break up large changelists

It is necessary to avoid generating changelists that are too large and support them with good comments to reduce the pressure of the reviewer.

- Respond graciously to critiques

Reviews should not be taken personally, because your code is not an extension of yourself. 

- Be patient when your reviewer is wrong

Sometimes reviewers get it wrong. In this case, you have to be patient and take it as an alert too, because your code could have made the reviewer wrong. If this is not the case, everyone is wrong.

- Communicate your responses explicitly

You have to communicate when you have corrected the code of the reviews, to avoid misunderstandings and that everyone can continue with their work.

- Artfully solicit missing information

A good method to ask for why this thing is wrong is to ask: "What changes would be helpful?". This question seems defensive and is open to criticism.

- Award all ties to your reviewer

It is possible that at some point your reviewer is not correct, maybe you are not either. At this time you should communicate and find a solution.

- Minimize lag between rounds of review

Once you send your code out, driving the review to completion should be your highest priority. Delays increase complexity and waste your reviewer's time
